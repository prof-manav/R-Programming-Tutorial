# To print the value, we simply write the value or variable
# or use print function

"Hello World!" #This will print Hello World

a <- 2 # Assign value 2 to a
a      # Print value of a, which is 2
print(a) # Print value of a, which is 2

b <- "Hello World!"
b      # Print "Hello World"
print(b) # Print "Hello World"

c <- 2 + 3i
c      # Print 2+3i
print(c) # Print 2+3i
